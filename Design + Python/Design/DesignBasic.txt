Design fundamentals

Client Server Model
Client --> DNS query --> get Ip address --> Makes reuest to Server
So DNS server must be reachable if internal/private local DNS server must be set up.

install dig utils 
sudo yum install bind-utils 
/> dig command used to do a dns query to find the ipaddress of server if you know the url or hostname

browser/clients send http/https request to server by getting dig command ipAddress use it to send request.
Server ports are opened to listen ti requests from server.

http use port 80
https uses port 443 univesally decided long time age

use netcat command for port and ip address tests also called nc commmand
yum install nmap-ncat.x86_64 //centos

server opens port and listens using nc command
~rkhire$ nc -l 9017
hi this is an example for network port open

Anything type on client using nc command is show on sevrer as well
~rkihre$ nc 127.0.0.1 9017
hi this is an example for network port open


NETWORK PROTOCOLS
Ip : internet protocol
    IP Header(bytes): source Ip Address + Destination Ip Address + Total Size of Packet + internet Protocol version its using

TCP : Transmission Control protocol
    build on top of IP protocol
    TCP connection created using Handsake protocol ( client requests , server responds ok + client responds connnection created) ==> timeouts
    Ordered and srtructure Ip packets transfer 
    Error free (corrupt free , resend failed packets)
    uses multiple Ip packets for sending large amount of data
    TCP Header : Ordering information + checksum
